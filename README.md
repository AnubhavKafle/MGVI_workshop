# MGVI workshop

This repository contains the materials for the MGVI workshop on "Introduction to AlphaFold3". The workshop is organized into several parts each day, covering different topics in the context of molecular docking.

Here's a brief overview of what you can expect to cover:

## Day 1

- Protein structure 101 - by Mothar
- What is AlphaFold and what it is not
- Basic Alphafold3 server familirasation

## Day 2

- Know your proteins and Ligand (HIV-1 protease in our workshop)
- Know HIV-1 protease mutations
- Visualising mutations in ChimeraX
- Visualising ligand molecule and its binding pattern
- Measuring distances between atoms/residues in ChimeraX

## Day 3

- Introduction to Molecular docking
- Setting up the protein structure for docking
- Processing ligand molecules
- Defining binding sites and search spaces
- Running molecular docking simulations
- Analyzing and visualizing results in ChimeraX
